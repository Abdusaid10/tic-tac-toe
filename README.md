# Description
This is the second collaborative Ruby project on building the tic-tac-toe game. There are two folders namely, the "lib" and "bin" folders. The bin folder contains the intro to the game class; and the lib folder contains two files namely, the board.rb and the player.rb, which contain the actual game logic. 
# How to play
<ul>
<li>Two players are needed.</li> 
<li>They are required to input their chosen names.</li> 
<li>Afterwards each player chooses a number between 1 - 9.</li>
<li>Depending on the number chosen, it will be marked on the board with the mark of either "X" for one player and "O" for another player.</li>
<li>The chosen number can not be chosen twice.</li>
<li>Once a selected mark appears three consecutive times either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, then that player with the mark is the winner.</li>
<li>If there is no any three consecutive mark, then it becomes a draw.</li>
</ul>
